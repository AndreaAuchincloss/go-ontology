## Before you write a new request, please consider the following: 

- **Does the term already exist?** Before submitting suggestions for new ontology terms, check whether the term exist, either as a primary term or a synonym term. To do this, search the ontology using the [AmiGO] (http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo) browser. Requests for new synonyms or clarification of textual definitions are also welcomed.

- **Should you be using TermGenie instead?** When requesting a new term, first consider whether the request should be submitted using TermGenie. If you curate the ontology regularly and are familiar with the tools and resources of the GOC, we invite you to use one of the templates available from TermGenie, which allow you to automatically create terms that are similar in structure to other terms already in GO. Learn more about using TermGenie and explore examples on the use of templates on the [TermGenie Documentation Pages] (http://go.termgenie.org/help/index.html)

- If you have not yet become familiar with TermGenie, we suggest that you submit your ontology updates using the [GOC GitHub tracker] (https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/issues). 

## Guidelines for creating GitHub tickets with contributions to the ontology:

1. **Write a detailed request:** Please be specific and include as many details as necessary, providing background information, and if possible, suggesting a solution. GOC editors will be better equipped to address your suggestions if you offer details regarding *'what is wrong'*, *'why'*, and *'how to fix it'*.

2. **Provide examples and references:** Please include PMIDs for new term requests, and include also screenshots, or URLs illustrating the current ontology structure for other types of requests. This will be very helpful to GOC ontology editors, as everyone's settings may be different for their GO browser/editor. 

3. **For new term request:** Be sure to provide suggestions for label (name), definition, references, position in hierarchy, etc.

4. **For updates to relationships:** Provide details of the current axioms, why you think they are wrong or not sufficient, and what exactly should be added or removed.

5. Tickets with insufficient detail will be marked with a *'More info needed'* label to alert the submitter.
