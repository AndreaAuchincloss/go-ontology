Please follow this guideline when creating GitHub tickets

- Be specific. Add as many details to your issue, provide background information and if possible suggest a resolution. Keep in mind that the person trying to address your ticket may not have the same background than you have, so please be explicit. What is wrong, why, how to fix etc.
- Provide examples. PMIDs for new term requests, screenshots/hyperlinks for current issues

For new term requests, please provide label, definition, references, position in hierarchy etc

For update to relationships, please provide details of current axioms, why they are wrong/not sufficient, and what *exactly* should be added/removed
