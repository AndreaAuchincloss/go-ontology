Users can request complex IDs from IntAct by filling the Complex submission template and emailing it to intact-help@ebi.ac.uk or bmeldal@ebi.ac.uk with as much detail as possible.

Complex submission template
 
Please supply as much information as possible to allow us to make your term.

Complex names:
Most commonly known name (recommended name):
Synonyms (could be any and many!):
 
Participants:
UniProt IDs for proteins (and their binding regions and stoichiometry - if available)
ChEBI IDs for small molecules (and stoichiometry - if available)
RNAcentral IDs for ncRNAs (and stoichiometry - if available)
 
Evidence
PMID for papers showing that the complex exists (if you are familiar with IntAct please add the IntAct interaction AC if applicable) 
Note: It should be evidence for all or most of the participants, not lots of binaries and not from high throughput experiments.
 
Additional information:
PMIDs that show what the complex does and where (so we can add MF & BP GO terms, see below).
 
Description:
A nice, concise description would help, similar to that required for GO term submissions :)
 
Properties:
Any additional information such as molecular weight of the COMPLEX, size, buried surface area, stokes radius, binding regions…
 
GO annotations:
Any terms that apply to the COMPLEX:
CC for the complex class and the cellular location (e.g. nucleus, plasma membrane…)
MFs & BPs: as many as applicable
Please supply PMIDs if possible
 
Xrefs (if applicable):
wwPDB
EC number (for enzymes)

Alternatively, new complexes can now also be requested directly from the yellow tile on the new CP homepage (www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal) but that's just a help-desk message until we get round to create a form behind that tile.
